Idea: Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps.
system broadcasts:
   Android system sends broadcasts when various system events occur, such as Airplane mode On/Off. System 
   broadcasts are sent to all apps that are subscribed to receive the event. The broadcast message itself 
   is wrapped in an Intent object whose action string identifies the event that occurred (for example android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE).
